		<div class="alert">Warning: DDoS attacks are illegal and can result in serious consequences.</div>
		<p>A DDoS attack, or distributed denial-of-service attack, is a malicious attempt to disrupt the normal traffic of a targeted server or network by overwhelming it with a flood of internet traffic from multiple sources.</p>
		<p>These attacks are legal because they can cause serious damage to businesses, organizations, and individuals. They can lead to loss of revenue, damage to reputation, and even data breaches.</p>
		<p>If you suspect that you are a victim of a DDoS attack, it is important to report it to the proper authorities and seek assistance from a cybersecurity professional.</p>
